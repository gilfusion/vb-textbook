# 3.8 Unit 3 Writing Assignment

Computer science is the study of computers and algorithmic processes, including their principles, their hardware and software designs, their applications, and their impact on society.  It is a broad topic, not just about building programs but also including a number of math-related subjects. It took the hard work of many people over many years and decades to discover what we have discovered about what computers can (and cannot) do. For this writing assignment, we will look at some of that hard work and the people who did it.
