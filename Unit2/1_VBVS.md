# 2.1 Visual Basic, Visual Studio, and LINQPad

## Visual Basic
Visual Basic (or VB for short) is a programming language. It has its own vocabulary and grammar, designed to be a cross between plain English and mathematical notation, intended to be relatively easy to read.

BASIC - Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code - was created at Dartmouth College in 1964. Micro-Soft has written dialects of BASIC since its establishment.

The computer does not natively understand Visual Basic code. To run a VB program, it needs to be either compiled or interpreted. A **compiler** is a program that translates VB code into a form that the computer does natively understand (or something similar). An **interpreter** is a program that can read VB code and do what it says.

## Visual Studio and LINQPad
We will be using two different programs to write code in the VB language.

One of these is called Visual Studio. It combines a color-coded editor with a compiler and tools for finding and fixing bugs in your programs. These kinds of programs are called **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)**.

Visual Studio is not the only IDE you can use to create VB programs. Two others are SharpDevelop (some versions) and MonoDevelop (also works on Linux or Mac).

Likewise, VB is not the only language you can use in Visual Studio. Some of the others include C++, JavaScript, Python, C#, F#, TypeScript, and Ruby.

The other program we will be using in this class is called LINQPad. It is designed more for quick testing of code before copying and pasting it into Visual Studio. However, it also has the color-coded editor, an interpreter (of sorts) to test your code quickly, and, in some versions, tools for finding and fixing bugs in your code. Therefore, LINQPad can also be considered a lightweight IDE. LINQPad also lets you write code in the C# and F# languages in addition to VB.

If you do not want to use an IDE at all, you can also type a VB program in Notepad and manually run the compiler from the command line. (Both are preinstalled on most recent versions of Windows.)

## Questions
1. Name 3 IDEs that you can use to create VB programs.
2. Name 4 languages that you can use in Visual Studio.
3. What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
