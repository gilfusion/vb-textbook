# 2.5b Aside: Autocomplete and "IntelliSense"

IntelliSense is the name of the autocomplete feature in Visual Studio. (LINQPad also has an autocomplete feature, but it is only available in the paid version of the program.) Most of the items listed in IntelliSense have icons next to them, which will tell you what they are. Here are a few of the icons shown in Visual Basic programs.
|Icon	|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|![](Module.png)|A module<br>(You can use it as an object.)
|![](Enum.png)|An enumeration<br>(You can use it as an object.)
|![](Class.png)<br>![](Structure.png)|A class or structure<br>(You can sometimes use it as an object.)
|![](Method.png)|A method
|![](Property.png)<br>![](Field.png)|A property
|![](Constant.png)<br>![](EnumConstant.png)|A constant<br>(You can use it in expressions like a property but cannot use it on the left-hand side of an assignment statement.)
If you want to see all the objects and methods available for your program, check out the Object Browser in the View menu in Visual Studio. Watch out, though. There's a lot of them.
