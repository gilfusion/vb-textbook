# 1.8 Unit 1 Writing Assignment
Choose two algorithms to research from the same category:
|Sorting	|Shortest Path	        |Square Roots   |
|-----------|-----------------------|---------------|
|Quicksort	|Dijkstra's algorithm	|Newton's method
|Merge sort	|Bellman-Ford algorithm	|Fast inverse square root
|Heap sort	|A* search algorithm	|Babylonian method
1. In a paragraph or two, answer the following questions for each of the two algorithms you chose:
    * Who developed each algorithm?
    * When was the algorithm developed?
    * What is it used for (this should be similar for your two algorithms, but be sure to highlight any differences)?
    * How does the algorithm work?
2. Compare and contrast the algorithms in terms of accuracy, speed, complexity, and what techniques they use.
3. Use and cite at least two sources.
