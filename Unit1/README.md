## Unit 1 Objectives
By the end of this unit, you should be able...
- To follow instructions in the same way a computer would.
- To write instructions similar to ones that would be given to a computer.
- To describe "classic" searching and sorting algorithms such as linear search, binary search, bubble sort, and insertion sort.
- To create simple problem solutions using a block-based programming language.
- To define Boolean logic (or Boolean algebra), determine the results of a logical NOT, AND, OR, or XOR operation, and fill in truth tables for the logical NOT, AND, OR, and XOR operations.
- To understand how binary numbers work and add them by hand.
- To convert between number systems using a calculator program.
- To understand how computers represent text using character sets and encoding and to convert characters to their corresponding character codes and vice versa using a table.
