# Intro to Computer Programming using Visual Basic

This is the "textbook" (really just organized notes and worksheets) for my high school VB programming class.

## Units

* [Unit 1 - Concepts of Computer Science](Unit1/0_Overview.md)
    * Fundamental concepts that will be helpful in understanding programming (algorithms, Boolean logic, binary, ASCII/Unicode, etc.)
* [Unit 2 - Basics of Visual Basic](Unit2/0_Overview.md)
    * Enough to write short VB programs (methods, properties, variables, etc.)
* [Unit 3 - Control Flow](Unit3/0_Overview)
    * Control structures such as subprograms, branching, and loops
* Unit 4 - Data Structures (work in progress)
    * Simple data structures such as arrays and tuples, with a brief mention of classes
* Unit 5 - Functions (work in progress)
    * A slightly more in-depth look at writing subprograms and functions, including recursion
* Unit 6 - History (work in progress)
    * Trying out a variety of low- and high-level programming languages from the past and present
